# Next.js App with MongoDB, Prisma Adapter, and API

Welcome to your Next.js application! This README will guide you through setting up and understanding the components of your project.

## Overview

This Next.js application integrates MongoDB as the database, Prisma Adapter for database ORM, and provides an API. It also includes various dependencies for development and functionality.

## Dependencies

- **@auth/prisma-adapter**: Prisma adapter for authentication.
- **@prisma/client**: Prisma client for database ORM.
- **eslint**: JavaScript linting utility for code quality.
- **eslint-config-next**: ESLint configuration for Next.js projects.
- **firebase**: Firebase SDK for various services (potentially for authentication or other features).
- **next**: React framework for server-side rendering and client-side rendering.
- **next-auth**: Authentication library for Next.js.
- **react**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **react-dom**: React library for DOM manipulation.
- **react-quill**: Quill rich text editor as a React component.
- **swr**: React Hooks library for data fetching.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
3. **Configuration**: Configure your MongoDB database credentials and any other necessary environment variables.
4. **Run the App**: Execute `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the development server.

## Usage

- **Prisma Adapter**: Utilize `@auth/prisma-adapter` for authentication purposes. This provides a seamless integration with Prisma ORM.
- **Prisma Client**: Use `@prisma/client` for interacting with the MongoDB database. Prisma Client is an auto-generated type-safe query builder that enables you to write database queries using TypeScript.
- **Next.js API**: Leverage Next.js API routes for building your backend API endpoints. These routes can be found in the `pages/api` directory.
- **Firebase**: If Firebase is being used, ensure proper configuration and utilize its services for features like authentication, cloud functions, or storage.
- **React Quill**: Integrate `react-quill` for incorporating a rich text editor component into your application.
- **SWR**: Use SWR for data fetching in React components. It provides hooks for fetching, caching, and updating data from the server.
